FileReader


Program was Written in C# using Visual Studio Community. 

To use, the directory written in the code will need to be changed and the program rebuilt. 

The program is in the FolderFileRead folder as Program.cs. The executable for the program is found in bin/Debug. However this executable is currently built with a directory suited to my own computer.


The folder "Coding Samples From other Projects" involves two scripts written to be a part of a minigame, where logs progress down a line and can be picked up by the saw. These interact through the Unity Engine and can't function on their own due to lack of assets.
